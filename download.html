	<p>
	The objective in extreme multi-label learning is to learn a classifier that can automatically tag a datapoint with the most relevant subset of labels from an extremely large label set. Parabel is a hybrid 1-vs-All/tree ensemble which efficiently learns a balanced label hierarchy from training data so as to cut overall training and prediction costs from linear to logarithmic in the number of labels. It then learns a probabilistic model based on the learnt label hierarchy for the joint label distribution conditioned on a data point. This model generalizes the multi-class hierarchical softmax model used in language modelling and word-vector embeddings to the multi-label setting. Finally, Parabel develops efficient log-time training and prediction algorithms based on the proposed probabilistic model. As a result, Parabel is able to match state-of-the-art 1-vs-All accuracies while being up to 600-900x faster at training and 60-13,000x faster at prediction. Parabel can also be up to 20x faster at training, have 10x lower model size and be up to 9% more accurate than PfastreXML. Parabel can train on millions of labels and datapoints within a few hours on a single core of a desktop and make predictions in milliseconds per test point. Please refer to the paper <a href="#Prabhu18">[1]</a> for more details.

	<h3>Performance Evaluation</h3>

	Scripts for performance evaluation are only available in Matlab. To compile these scripts, execute "make" in the Tools folder from the Matlab terminal.<br>
	Following command is executed from Tools/metrics folder and outputs a struct containing all the metrics:
	<pre>	[metrics] = get_all_metrics([test score matrix], [test label matrix], [inverse label propensity vector])</pre>

	<h3> Miscellaneous </h3>

	<ul>
		<li>
		The data format required by Parabel for feature and label input files is different from the format used in the <a href="../../downloads/XC/XMLRepository.html">repository</a> datasets.
		To convert from the repository format to Parabel format, run the following command from the 'Tools' folder:
		<pre>	perl convert_format.pl [repository data file] [output feature file name] [output label file name] </pre>
		</li>

		<li>
		Scripts are provided in the 'Tools' folder for sparse matrix inter conversion between Matlab .mat format and text format.<br>
		To read a text matrix into Matlab:
		<pre>	[matrix] = read_text_mat([text matrix name]); </pre>
		To write a Matlab matrix into text format:
		<pre>	write_text_mat([Matlab sparse matrix], [text matrix name to be written to]);</pre>
		</li>

		<li>
		To generate inverse label propensity weights, run the following command inside 'Tools/metrics' folder on Matlab terminal:
		<pre>	[weights vector] = inv_propensity([training label matrix],A,B); </pre>
		A,B are the parameters of the inverse propensity model. Following values are to be used over the benchmark datasets:

		<pre>
		Wikipedia-LSHTC: A=0.5,  B=0.4
		Amazon:          A=0.6,  B=2.6
		Other:		 A=0.55, B=1.5
		</pre>

	</ul>

	<h2>Toy Example</h2>

	The zip file containing the source code also includes the EUR-Lex dataset as a toy example. To run Parabel on the EUR-Lex dataset, execute "bash sample_run.sh" (Linux) or "sample_run" (Windows) in the Parabel folder.<br>
